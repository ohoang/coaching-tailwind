              Here&apos;s the harsh truth about learning game:
              Some guys make massive leaps and get insane results in a matter of months,
              while most spend long periods of time stuck in mediocrity,
              repeating easily fixable mistakes over and over again.

              I faced the anxiety, fear, and pain of rejection.
